# React Suspense Demo.

Sample implementation of concurrent React

Should use [react-cache](https://github.com/palmerhq/the-platform/blob/master/example/vendor/react-cache/react-cache.development.js) from here as there is version compatibility issue.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
